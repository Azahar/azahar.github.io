  name: "Amanda"
  surname: "Cavallaro Caruso"
  company: "GDG Cloud London"
  title: "Computer Scientist"
  bio: '<p>Amanda is a computer scientist who can speak four languages and loves chatbots. The most inspiring geek book she has ever read is Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. During her free time she is an aikidoka, a volunteer organiser at GDG Cloud / WTM London, she loves to attend tech meetups and to work on her own personal projects to practice different programming languages. This is she singing in four languages https://goo.gl/iSfcjF her singing skills are rather disappointing, though. If she was a type of music she would definitely be a Power Metal song. Amanda is a spontaneous person who tries her best to help everyone around her, and when she likes the cause, she will not rest until she can help you. Sometimes she takes her life is at maximum speed such as the song Destruction Preventer and some other times she is complaining about the cold in a mood similar to the song The Misery. She is a big fan of the Finnish band Sonata Arctica, and these two songs are theirs by the way.</p>'
